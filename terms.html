Changes to Terms or Services  
We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications via the Services.

OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR 
SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES ARISING OUT OF OR IN 
CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE 
THE SERVICES OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, 
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL 
THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY 
OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO 
HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW 
THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

Dispute Resolution 
If you are having a problem with a Service, many issues can be resolved by contacting us. You may find resolution by clicking on the “Support” link on that App. Before bringing a formal legal case, first contact our Customer Support team at ezpzapplication to address your issue. Most disputes can be resolved that way.  
Governing Law and Venue 
These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of Japan without regard to its choice of law or conflict of law principles. Further, you and we agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Tokyo, Japan to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Services.  
General Terms  
These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between us and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between us and you regarding the Services and Content. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.  
You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. We may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.  
Any notices or other communications provided by us under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.  
Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by our duly authorized representative. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
